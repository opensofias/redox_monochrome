# redox monochrome
these are monochromatic vector icons (or glyphs), somewhat based on on my previous duochrome icons. i'd like to contribute them to the Redox operating system project, and release them to into the public domain using the unlicense.

## design principles
* monochromacy:  solid, single colored shapes used on a single-colored background. the color of the shape may be varied based on context.
* color coded: the (default) color of a glyph represents it's category
 * #C08040 (orange/brown-ish) for storange objects, such as files and directories
 * #4080C0 (azure-ish) for hardware
 * #40C080 (mint-ish) for actions
 * #C04080 (pink-ish) for people, places, social and intitutional objects
* minimal skeumorphism, prefer schemes over metaphors
* beauty
