# redox monochrome
these are monochromatic vector icons (or glyphs), somewhat based on on my previous duochrome icons. i'd like to contribute them to the Redox operating system project, and release them to into the public domain (see unlicense.txt).

## design principles
* monochromacy:  solid, single colored shapes used on a single-colored background. the color of the shape may be varied based on context.
* color coded: the (default) color of a glyph represents it's category (this is pretty experimental and might easily change)
 * #C08040 (orange-ish) for storange objects, such as files and directories
 * #4080C0 (azure-ish) for hardware
 * #40C080 (mint-ish) for actions
 * #C04080 (pink-ish) for people, places, social and "real world" objects
 * #80C040 (lime-ish) for applications
 * #8040C0 (purple-ish) for file/data formats
* minimal skeumorphism, prefer systems over metaphors
* beauty

## history

the icons are based on and inspired by my previos "duochrome" icon set, which can be downloaded here: http://asset-0.soupcdn.com/asset/10979/9034_0f3f.7z
